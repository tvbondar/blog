## About Me

Bondar Tatyana - student of the Faculty of Physics, Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia. I study programming, mathematics, languages, and am interested in the field of applied computer linguistics. I believe in miracles and that Monday begins on Saturday.
