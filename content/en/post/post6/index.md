## March 8th in the main building

For the holiday, the main building held a campaign with the distribution of cute stickers and you could send a postcard with wishes to any person from the university. I like the idea, very cute

## Gifts for girls

I made teddy bears for the girls and gave them. The bears turned out crooked, but cute.

## Going to the cinema

Went with my boyfriend to see Deadpool 3. I liked it, and this little bugger fell asleep in the middle of the screening. I was offended.

## Result

A very calm and sweet week, 9/10
