## RAMT

Back in late December we bought tickets to RAMT for the operetta "Scarlet Sails". We went on the weekend, generally liked the costumes and songs. I was disappointed in the scenery, and I also didn't understand why Gray looks like he's 20 years older than Assol and why he didn't buy scarlet fabric for the sails, like in the story, but just poured wine on the white sails. I didn't get the joke, why waste wine, all the romance was ruined. Rating: 7/10

## Homework

Doing lab work on operating systems until 2am is already normal. It's terribly difficult, a lot of time is wasted, I hope to cope with it faster.

## Classes

The schedule is good this semester, lots of online classes, 3 days of in-person study with 2 classes. I saw my classmates, I'm glad that now there is a lot of time for self-study.

## Rating of the week

I'll give it 6/10. I spend a lot of time on assignments now. As soon as I finish them, I need to go and unwind.
