This language has gained immense popularity all over the world and has had a significant influence on many other programming languages. It is the predecessor of such languages ​​as C++, C#, Java.
The C language has its roots in the ALGOL language (stands for ALGorithmic Language), which was created in 1958 by a committee of European and American computer scientists at a meeting in 1958 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. The language was a response to some of the shortcomings of the FORTRAN language and an attempt to correct them.
Inspired by the ALGOL-60 language, the Cambridge University Mathematical Laboratory, together with the Computer Department of the University of London, created the CPL (Combined Programming Language) language in 1963.
The CPL language was considered complex, and in response to this, Martin Richardson created the BCPL language in 1966, the main purpose of which was to write compilers. Nowadays it is hardly used, but at one time it played an important role due to its good portability.
BCPL served as an ancestor for the B language, developed in 1969 at the already familiar AT&T Bell Telephone Laboratories, by the equally familiar Ken Thompson and Dance Ritchie.
The B language was used to write the earliest versions of UNIX. It was this language that served as the immediate predecessor of the C language.
The C programming language was developed within the walls of Bell Labs between 1969 and 1973. As Ritchie himself admitted, the most active period of creativity was in 1972.
The success of C is mainly due to the fact that a significant part of the UNIX operating system was written in it, which eventually gained great popularity. If we count the number of operating systems currently in use, developed on the basis of UNIX, then it is the most widespread system in the world. Due to its prevalence, as well as the fact that at the moment the volume of the operating system is measured in millions of lines of code (for example, the latest versions of Linux contain more than 10,000,000 lines of code), the task of rewriting UNIX into another language becomes almost impossible (it should also be taken into account that errors will inevitably arise during manual rewriting, which will significantly reduce the stability of the work, and when translating using software, the performance of the code will suffer). In addition, the C language, being close to the hardware implementation of the computer, allows you to squeeze much more out of it than many other programming languages. This circumstance shows the senselessness of translating UNIX into another language. Thus, if other programming languages ​​​​may disappear over time, giving way to new technologies, the C language will live as long as UNIX lives. That is, as long as computers exist in the form in which we imagine them. In the late 1970s, the C language began to displace BASIC, which at that time was the leading language in the field of microcomputer programming. In the 1980s, it was adapted to the IBM-PC architecture, which led to a significant jump in its popularity. At the same time, Bjarne Stroustrup began developing a programming language that would combine the syntax of the popular C language and the concept of object-oriented programming, which was becoming increasingly popular, so the development of the C++ language began. While C was gaining more and more popularity, compilers for it were released by different companies, and often a program that compiled on the compiler of one company did not compile on the compiler of another. All this was due to the lack of a clearly defined C language standard. All developers were guided by the book by Kernighan and Ritchie, but interpreted it in their own way. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) took up the development of the C language standard. The first version of the standard was released in 1989 and was called C89. In 1990, having made minor changes to the standard, it was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization ISO. At that time, it became known under the code ISO/IEC 9899:1990, but among programmers, the name associated with the year of adoption of the standard has become established: C90. The latest version of the standard is ISO/IEC 9899:1999, also known as C99, which was adopted in 2000.
The C99 standard is now supported to a greater or lesser extent by all modern C compilers. Ideally, code written in C in compliance with the standards and without the use of hardware- and system-dependent calls becomes both hardware- and platform-independent code.
In 2007, work began on the next C language standard: C1x.
